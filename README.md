# The Cloud-Based E-Commerce Analytics Platform

## Overview
The **Cloud-Based E-Commerce Analytics Platform** is a scalable, microservices-based solution designed for real-time data processing and analytics in e-commerce. The platform leverages cloud-native technologies such as Docker for containerization and Apache Spark for distributed data processing to provide businesses with actionable insights into their sales trends, customer segmentation, and personalized recommendations.

## Features
- Real-time data ingestion and processing.
- Scalable microservices architecture.
- Docker-based containerization for easy deployment and management.
- Apache Spark for distributed data processing and low-latency analytics.
- Supports both relational (PostgreSQL) and NoSQL databases.
- Interactive dashboard for visualizing data insights.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend:**
  - Node.js (Data Ingestion Service)
  - Apache Spark (Data Processing Service)
  - Python/Flask (API layer)
- **Frontend:**
  - React.js (Data Visualization Service)
  - D3.js (Data visualization library)
- **Database:**
  - PostgreSQL (for relational data)
  - MongoDB (optional for NoSQL support)
- **Cloud Services:**
  - AWS EC2 (Virtual machines for hosting services)
  - AWS S3 (Storage)
  - AWS RDS (Managed PostgreSQL database)

## System Requirements
- **Docker** (version >= 20.10)
- **Node.js** (version >= 14.x)
- **Apache Spark** (version >= 3.x)
- **PostgreSQL** (version >= 12.x)

## Installation and Setup
### Prerequisites
1. Install Docker on your local machine or server.
2. Ensure that Node.js and Spark are properly installed if deploying locally.
3. Set up a PostgreSQL database and update the `.env` file with the database credentials.

### Steps
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/cloud-ecommerce-analytics.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd cloud-ecommerce-analytics
   ```
3. **Build and run Docker containers:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
4. **Run migrations for the database (PostgreSQL):**
   ```bash
   docker exec -it <container_name> python manage.py migrate
   ```
5. **Access the platform:**
   - Open a browser and go to `http://localhost:8000` for the dashboard.

## Usage
- **Data Ingestion:**
  - Data can be ingested via the provided API at `/api/ingest` (POST method) by sending e-commerce transaction data in JSON format.
  
- **Data Processing:**
  - The processing service analyzes and computes insights such as sales trends, customer segmentation, etc.
  
- **Data Visualization:**
  - The results are displayed on the dashboard, which includes interactive charts and reports.

## API Endpoints
- **POST** `/api/ingest`: To ingest raw e-commerce data.
- **GET** `/api/visualize`: To fetch processed analytics data.

## Docker Commands
- **Start services:**
  ```bash
  docker-compose up
  ```
- **Stop services:**
  ```bash
  docker-compose down
  ```
- **View logs:**
  ```bash
  docker-compose logs
  ```
